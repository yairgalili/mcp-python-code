The `wait_for_server` function, defined in `grip/browser.py`, waits until a local server starts listening on a given host and port. It repeatedly checks using `is_server_running`, sleeping for 0.1 seconds between attempts. If a `cancel_event` is provided and set, it exits early. It returns True when the server is ready. This function is used in `wait_and_start_browser` to ensure the server is running before opening the browser.
